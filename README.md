**ee-me** is a script for FiveM that enables the **/me** command, which displays actions above players' heads.

## Installation

1. Download the project to your computer.
2. Rename the downloaded folder to **ee-me**.
3. Copy the folder to the **resources** directory of your FiveM server.
4. Open your server's **server.cfg** file and add the following line:

   ```
   ensure ee-me
   ```

5. Start your server, and the **/me** command will be available for use.

## Usage

To use the **/me** command in the game, simply type **/me** followed by the action you want to display above your head. For example:
